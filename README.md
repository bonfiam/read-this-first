# Data for Democracy

Data for Democracy's mission is to be an inclusive community for data scientists and technologists to volunteer and collaborate on projects that make a positive impact on society.

## Getting Started  

* Read more about our our [origin story](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/origin-story-b740f14ca6ed#.psbzqw21y).  
* We use Slack and GitHub as our primary means of organization and communication. Email jonathon [at] datafordemocracy.org for an invite to the team.  
* Read about our [current projects](#current-projects), or check out how you can volunteer [across the community](#across-the-community).
* If you see a project you are interested in, join the project Slack channel, introduce yourself to the community and the project lead(s).  
* Visit project readme for specific instructions on who to contact or how to get started.
* Not sure which project you want to join? Introduce yourself in [#general](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/general/). Talk to a few project leads, let them know what you are interested in. Project leads can help you determine if a project is a good fit for you.
* Have an idea for a new project? Join [#project-ideas](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/project-ideas/) to start a discussion on a new project.
* Looking for a certain type of task, in any project? Check the [task digest](#task-digest).
* Not sure how to get started? Contact @gecky or @jonathon in the Slack, or check out the [#onboarding](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/onboarding/) channel, and we'll help you out. Also check out [#micro-projects](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/micro-projects/) for quick projects that'll help you get your feet wet.
* Want to pick up some skills before diving in? Check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/tutorials) which are all relevant to D4D projects and chat about it in [#learning](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/learning/).

See our guide to [get started](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first/blob/master/data-world.md). Contact @sya or @gabriela in Slack with questions

## Across the Community

While most of our work is [project based](#current-projects), the community is large and vibrant enough that we're looking for common needs across projects that the organization can support. These are ongoing roles that can be time consuming, but are also essential to making the community helpful to our partners and a valuable experience for our volunteers. Ping @jonathon in Slack if you'd like to help with the following:

### Storytelling
All of our projects are doing some interesting data gathering and analysis that we'd love to share with the world. We'd like to start publishing regular blog posts highlighting these resources, scheduling short interviews for the [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com) podcast, and discussing our work on social media so the larger community knows what we're doing and gets to see our work in progress. If you want to write, edit, tweet, and ideally organize this process, we'd like to hear from you.

### Infrastructure and IT administration
We're doing this on a per-project basis, and would love someone to manage this process -- from GitHub access, to data sharing, to AWS permissions, and everything in between.  

### Matchmaker
The community has grown to a point where there is a lot of activity and a steady stream of new volunteers, which is awesome! We could use more people who know about the various projects that are happening along with the skills of the incoming volunteers, and can both match people to projects (ideally, to specific tasks), along with routinely surfacing new opportunities to the broader community for folks to get involved at all skill levels. @gecky and the individual project leads have been going above and beyond in this regard, and they need your help.

### Project Leads
You've probably noticed that there are a few people in every active project keeping the group on track, taking questions, and helping new folks get settled in -- that's by design. Leading a project can be a big time commitment, but it's hugely valuable to making sure we're doing useful work, and volunteers are getting the most out of volunteering. You don't need to be super technical, just organized and enthusiastic! **In particular we're looking for people to lead these projects:**
* An ongoing series of small projects with the city of Los Angeles' analytics team. You'll be the liason between the D4D community and the group in LA working with the Chief Data Officer.
* Tech to support immigration attorneys. We're talking with one national immigration law non-profit to make sure we're focused on what will have the most impact, and more partnerships will follow.

## Current projects  
We have many projects going in our slack community. Below is a list of some of our more active projects that are actively seeking help.

### [Assemble](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/assemble)  
**Slack:** [#assemble](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/assemble/)

**Project Description:** Community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.  

**Project Leads:** [@bstarling](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@bstarling/) [@nick](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@nick/)

### [Boston Crash Modeling](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling)
**Project Description:** This is an official collaboration between the City of Boston's Analytics Team and Data for Democracy. We want to build a crash prediction modeling application. This would combine things like [our crowdsourced safety concerns dataset](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/) and [crash reports](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VisionZero/) with a wide range of other data from our own open data portal as well as from other sources like the state's transportation and transit agencies, weather conditions feeds, and traffic reports from sites like Google. The end result will be a set of dynamic predictions we can use to identify potential trouble spots and direct timely safety interventions--everything from protected bike lanes and better-marked crosswalks to new street lights and traffic light timings. We'll make this publicly-available to everyone through a hosted map application, and develop the project as an open source template that can be adapted for use by other cities.

**Slack:** [#boston-crash-modeling](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/boston-crash-modeling/)

**Project Leads:** [@therriault](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@therriault/) (City of Boston lead), [@niccolley](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@niccolley/) (Data for Democracy lead)

### City of San Diego
**Project Description:** This is an ongoing collaboration with the analytics team at the city of San Diego. We'll be checking in with them on a regular basis to see what analysis or machine learning projects they need help with, and coordinating with the D4D community on a project-by-project basis to get things done. This is a great way to make a direct impact at the city level.

**Slack:** [#city-sandiego](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/city-sandiego/)

**Project Leads:** [@eric_bickel](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@eric_bickel/)

**Slack:** [#drug-spending](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/drug-spending/)  
**Project Description:** Help the public understand what their tax dollars are going toward. Eg, what % of the eligible population (and/or all Americans) are benefiting from Medicare prescription drug coverage? How many Medicare enrollees are being treated for common/relatable conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's, or depression? What proportion of Medicare prescription spending is on each of those conditions?

**Project Leads:** [@jenniferthompson](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@jenniferthompson/) [@mattgawarecki](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@mattgawarecki/)

### [Indivisible](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/indivisible)  
**Slack:** [#indivisible](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/indivisible/)

**Project Description:** A variety of civic activism organizations have sprung up in the wake of the election to help mobilize and empower people. The organizations often operate by sending out daily or weekly “actions” that their supporters partake in – whether calling a Member of Congress’s office, attending an event, or reading a key piece of information. This project we will build tools to
* Identify various actions available for users by aggregating different sources of data
* Provide a clean user interface to filter and select actions they are interested in
* Build a dashboard and track action progress/effectiveness over time
* Engage user interest through social media or similar means to identify tasks for more effective actions
**We need software and web developers**

**Project Leads:** [@pg](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@pg/) [@bonfiam](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@bonfiam/)
